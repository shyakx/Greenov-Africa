# What to Do While Waiting for Google Business Verification

## Current Status ✅
You've successfully created your Google Business Profile! Now you're waiting for verification.

**What you see:**
- ✅ "Google is processing your verification. It may take up to five days."
- ✅ Business marked as "NOT PUBLICLY VISIBLE" (this is normal - it will be visible after verification)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Website URL Mismatch

I noticed your Google Business Profile shows:

But your actual website is:
- **Website**: https://www.greenovafrica.com/

**Good news!** Your Google Business Profile already has the correct website URL: `https://www.greenovafrica.com/`

**This is correct!** No changes needed to the website URL in your Google Business Profile.
